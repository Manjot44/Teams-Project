\\Meeting 2 Minutes//

Attendees: All group members

The agenda of this meeting was as a quick catch-up of everyone's progress. It allowed us to quickly check weather or not we were operating on the same assumptions, and gave group members to ask any questions about the code. We also used this time to coordinate merge requests and when we planned on sending them. Lastly, we discussed the creation of a new testing file, which would contain some common tests which group members could import into the function specific test files to streamline the code.

The goal we set for the next meeting was that we wanted all group members to have completed the implementation and testing for their files so that everyone has passing pipelines.
Our next meeting will be on 7/03/22

\\Meeting 3 Minutes//

Attendees: All group members

The purpose of this meeting was to ensure everyone's code was up to scratch and was working well with everyone else. We looked at each other's tests to make sure there were no edge cases being missed, and when we reached the final deliverable we ensured that the master branch met the outlined specification.

Our next meeting time will be to review the feedback received and to look over iteration 2
